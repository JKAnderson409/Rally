## Meet your match ##
Rally utilizes a matchmaking algorithm based on elo scoring that is as reliable as it is innovative. Our database of New York-area tennis courts allows for the scheduling of matches against skill-appropriate players on both hard-surface and clay courts for players of all levels of experience.

To a tennis player without a regular club or league finding a good opponent is a difficult problem to solve.

To a student of game theory calculating skill levels in a zero-sum game is relatively simple give the ingenious Elo system, which has stood up to decades of scrutiny and remains as robust as ever.

To a software engineer the question of how to handle matchmaking and scheduling that is as usable on a mobile device as it is in a browser is interesting and fun to solve with the many tools and technologies available.

"Rally puts the tedium of finding an opponent to rest and gets us on the court doing what really matters: playing the sport." - Parker Muir
